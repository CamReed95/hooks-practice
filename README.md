# Hooks Practice Project

## Intro

This is a project I created initially for students to practice writing servers. Other students wanted to practice with hooks, so I modified the project. Now we're practicing with hooks instead of endpoints. Let's take a look at what the project already has in it. Let's start with the server folder.

### Server
- the ```db.json``` file just has an array of Disney movies
- our ```controller.js``` contains the methods that will run at our specified endpoints
    - the ```movies``` variable will hold our JSON array for us
    - the ```globalId``` will keep track of new ID's for us since this is a database-less project
    - review the methods just to familiarize yourself with what you should be expecting when you call these methods

### Src
- this is where we will be working 
### Public
This is just a standard React App public folder with a favicon, manifest, and html file.
